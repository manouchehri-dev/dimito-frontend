        "question": "How can I participate in presales?",
        "answer": "DMT tokens are released through structured presale events. All supply is distributed only through presales, ensuring complete transparency and market-based pricing."
      },
      "tokenValue": {
        "question": "How does token value increase?",
        "answer": "Profits from mining operations are used in three ways to strengthen token value: buying back tokens from the open market, injecting liquidity at higher prices, and market making in the secondary market."
      },
      "tokenValue2": {
        "question": "Do token holders have operational responsibilities?",
        "answer": "No. Token buyers have no operational or legal obligations regarding mining activities. Token ownership means participation in future net benefits, not shares or ownership in the mines."
      },
      "tokenValue3": {
        "question": "How is operational transparency guaranteed?",
        "answer": "A dedicated reporting module on the website provides real-time and historical views of each mine token's financial and operational performance, capital allocation methods, and profitability details."
      },
      "tokenValue4": {
        "question": "Can I sell my tokens?",
        "answer": "Yes. Immediately after presale, two markets are available: initial liquidity pool for instant trading, and secondary on-chain order book market for custom price trading."
      },
      "tokenValue5": {
        "question": "What guarantees exist for investor protection?",
        "answer": "Mine owners are required to provide valid licenses, feasibility studies, expert reports, and collateral equivalent to 2.5 times the funding amount, which is held under platform supervision."
